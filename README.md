# SubnetCalculator
We will develop a python application that will run in command line and calculates the following things by just providing the IP address:
•	Subnet address
•	Range
•	Number of valid hosts per subnet
•	Wildcard mask 
•	Mask bits 
•	Random IP address generator from the subnet

We will use python language to develop this project which we have learned in COMP 216. We will use random and sys package for some calculations that we have covered in week second. We have studied about network and network topologies which will help us to understand our project in more technical way. We will use Jupyter Notebook to execute code.
